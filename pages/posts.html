         <h1 id="reconstructing-images-with-brush-and-colmap">Reconstructing images with Brush and COLMAP</h1>
   <p>Recently I have been experimenting with different ways of rendering images into a 3d workspace. I have tried all
      sorts of different tools, but Brush stands out among them as being both easy to get started with, while also not
      sacrificing on quality or speed.</p>
   <h2 id="reconstructing-your-images">Reconstructing your images</h2>
   <p>Brush has one disadvantage compared to other rendering engines: it can only render already reconstructed images.
      To do that, we will need another tool called COLMAP.</p>
   <ol>
      <li>
         <p>To download COLMAP, head to <strong><a href="https://github.com/colmap/colmap/releases/tag/3.13.0">this
                  link</a></strong>. Download either the CUDA or non-CUDA version depending on if you have an Nvidia
            GPU. Alternativelly if you are running linux you can use the <strong><a
                  href="https://colmap.github.io/install.html#pre-built-binaries">official guide linked
                  here</a></strong>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>Open colmap.bat and click on the <strong>&quot;Reconstruction&quot;</strong> menu and select
            <strong>&quot;Automatic reconstruction&quot;</strong>. You only want to specify 2 folders here, The
            Workspace folder and the folder with your source images. (Keep in mind COLMAP only supports OpenImageIO
            formats like JPG and PNG). Leave everything else at it is and <strong>press run</strong>.<img
               src="/assets/posts/gaussian blur/colmap_render_settings.png" alt="Automatic Reconstruction"> <br>
            If you did everything correctly, it should render and look like this.<img src="/assets/posts/gaussian blur/colmap_render.png"
               alt="COLMAP render"></p>
      </li>
   </ol>
   <h2 id="setting-up-brush">Setting up Brush</h2>
   <ol>
      <li>
         <p>Download Brush from this <strong><a href="https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/releases/tag/v0.3.0">GitHub
                  repo</a></strong>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>After opening it should load you into a very simple GUI.
            To open your freshly reconstructed images, click on <strong>&quot;Directory</strong> and select the
            <strong>Workspace folder</strong> you specified in COLMAP. It should have two folders inside like in the
            image below, <strong>Do not click</strong> on them and just press <strong>&quot;Select
               Folder&quot;</strong>. <img src="/assets/posts/gaussian blur/brush folder select.png" alt="Folder Select"> It should now open a settings
            menu. For a first try I would reccomened leaving everything at default and pressing
            <strong>&quot;Start&quot;</strong>. <img src="/assets/posts/gaussian blur/brush pre render.png" alt="Settings menu">
            It might take a bit for your project to render depending on which quality you selected. After it&#39;s
            rendered, you are pretty much done. (Shoutout to my awesome girlfriend for providing me with the sample
            images for this guide)<img src="/assets/posts/gaussian blur/brush pre render.png" alt="Eiskoffe render">Now you can export your project by clicking
            <strong>&quot;Control&quot;</strong> arrow right below <strong>&quot;Scene&quot;</strong> and click
            &quot;Export&quot;.</p>
      </li>
   </ol>
   <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
   <p>In the beginning I found all of this to be pretty confusing and scary but as this guide hopefully proved rendering
      images into a 3d workspace is not at all daunting but actually pretty easy if you take just a little bit of time
      to learn the basics. Also this is the first ever article I wrote so I am open to any critiques and suggestions.
